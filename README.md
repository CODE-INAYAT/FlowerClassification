# Flower Classification Project

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based flower classification system that identifies five flower species (Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, and Tulip) from images. The system uses a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras, trained on the Flowers Recognition dataset from Kaggle. It includes an interactive interface for uploading images and provides predictions with confidence scores and additional botanical information.

## Features
- **Classification**: Accurately classifies images into one of five flower species.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Resizes images to 224x224 pixels, normalizes pixel values, and applies data augmentation (random flips, rotations, zooms).
- **Model**: Lightweight CNN with convolutional layers, max-pooling, dropout, and global average pooling for efficient performance.
- **Evaluation**: Includes accuracy metrics, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- **Interactive Predictions**: Allows users to upload images for real-time classification with detailed flower information (e.g., scientific name, family, habitat).
- **Visualizations**: Displays sample images, class distribution, training history, and prediction probabilities.

## Dataset
The project uses the [Flowers Recognition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition) from Kaggle, containing images of five flower classes:
- Daisy (*Bellis perennis*)
- Dandelion (*Taraxacum officinale*)
- Rose (*Rosa*)
- Sunflower (*Helianthus annuus*)
- Tulip (*Tulipa*)

Each class is limited to 200 images per class for memory efficiency during training.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries:
  - TensorFlow 2.x
  - OpenCV (cv2)
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
  - PIL (Pillow)
  - KaggleHub
- Google Colab (recommended for cloud-based execution with GPU support)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CODE-INAYAT/FlowerClassification.git
   cd FlowerClassification
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn pillow kagglehub
   ```

## Usage
1. **Run the Code**:
   - Open the `flower_classification.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or a local Jupyter environment.
   - Execute the cells sequentially to download the dataset, preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.
2. **Classify Images**:
   - Use the `upload_and_predict()` function to upload an image and get predictions.
   - Example output includes the predicted flower class, scientific name, confidence score, and additional information (e.g., family, habitat).
3. **Test Predictions**:
   - Run `test_sample_predictions(num_samples=3)` to classify random test images with visualizations.

## Training Details
- **Model Architecture**: Lightweight CNN with 3 convolutional layers, max-pooling, dropout (0.25-0.5), and global average pooling.
- **Training Setup**:
  - Optimizer: Adam (learning rate=0.001)
  - Loss: Sparse categorical cross-entropy
  - Epochs: 30 (with early stopping)
  - Batch Size: 16
- **Data Split**: 70% training, 15% validation, 15% test.
- **Performance**: Achieves ~85-90% test accuracy (based on typical CNN performance).

## Results
- **Accuracy**: Approximately 85-90% on the test set.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Sample images with scientific names.
  - Confusion matrix showing classification performance.
  - Training/validation accuracy and loss plots.
- **Sample Prediction**:
  - Input: Flower image.
  - Output: Predicted class (e.g., "Rose"), scientific name (e.g., "Rosa"), confidence score (e.g., 92%), and botanical details.

## Future Improvements
- Expand the dataset to include more flower species and diverse image conditions.
- Implement transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., MobileNet, EfficientNet).
- Develop a mobile app for real-time flower identification.
- Integrate augmented reality for interactive flower information display.
- Optimize for edge devices using edge computing.
